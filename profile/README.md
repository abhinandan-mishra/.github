# 👋 Hello there!

This GitHub account was created and used during my time working at **Cosmocloud** for organizational and project-specific purposes.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This account exists only to manage, access, or collaborate on repositories related to my work at Cosmocloud.

For my active, personal, and up-to-date work, please visit my main GitHub profile:

## About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with experience across frontend, backend, and system design, focused on building scalable systems and clean developer experiences. I enjoy working on complex problems, developer tooling, and product-driven engineering.

## Why this account exists

- Work-related repositories
- Organization access & permissions
- Internal or company-linked projects
- Historical contributions during employment

If you’re looking to collaborate, review my work, or connect professionally, my **primary GitHub account** is the right place.

Thanks for stopping by! 👋
